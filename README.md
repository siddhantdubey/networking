# Networking

I will not be taking any networking classes for my CS degree, so I need to learn it elsewhere. I'll be going through [CS Primer](https://csprimer.com/courses/), and implementing the exercises. I'll first do an exercise in Python, then redo it in OCaml. I chose Python because it's second nature to me so I can worry about the implementation logic and not syntax, and then OCaml so I can really learn the language. Hopefully, I take notes as well but that is probably not going to happen.
